# project0
The project centers around index.html which contains buttons that are linke to the other pages. 
The first page is called ryan's interests which contains a bootstrap table containing my interests and outside the table is 
a button leading to the home page. The second button leads to a page called about ryan which has an image of a man shrugging
and a caption saying page not found but thats what its supposed to say. The third page is called Contact Me which contains a 
form that asks you for your name and contact info then asks what type of contact info you put, then there is a submit button 
for you to press at the end. for the form i didn't add a way to collect the info so it is kind of useless. The fourth page is 
called Important Please Read but it contains text that just says i was messing around and thanks you for reading my webpage.
